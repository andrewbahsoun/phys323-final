# Physics 323 Final Project

## Project Context
Originally, I had a video data set containing videos of 12 different hand washing steps. Part of the dataset came from a public dataset, [available here](https://zenodo.org/records/4537209). Then, my GCI group recorded more videos (~30 minutes per step).    

From here, we submitted our project to the GCI program. We used a PyTorch model that got hand data points using mediaPipe and trained a simple model on that. This model was ok, but had errors and only a 60% accuracy rate. Its failures came from the mediaPipe module being unable to recognize hands that were on top of eachother.

We ended up winning the best GCI project. [News.](https://news.chapman.edu/2024/05/31/this-ai-hand-washing-coach-may-help-prevent-the-spread-of-deadly-viruses/) But I knew this project could be improved with a CNN Image Classification Model. 

Now, I have taken on this project again to develop an image classification model. I always wanted to do this project at some point but didn't have the time. I decided to take it on for my Physics 323 final project. Thank you to Dr. Dressel for giving his students freedom on their projects, it allowed me to complete this project.
